Welcome, Horatio: welcome, good Marcellus.


MARCELLUS

, has this thing appear'd again -night?


BERNARDO

 have seen nothing.


MARCELLUS

Horatio says 'tis  our fantasy,
  not let belief take hold  
Touching this dreaded sight, twice seen  us:
Therefore  have entreated  along
With us  watch  minutes  this night;
That  again this apparition come,
  approve our eyes  speak  .


HORATIO

Tush, tush, 'twill not appear.


BERNARDO

Sit down awhile;

That   fortified against our story
  have two nights seen.


HORATIO

Well, sit  down,
 let us hear Bernardo speak  this.


BERNARDO

Last night  ,
 yond same star 's westward from  pole
Had made  course  illume  part  heaven

BERNARDO

MARCELLUS

'Tis gone,   not answer.


BERNARDO

How , Horatio!  tremble  look pale:

 think  't?


HORATIO

Before  God,  might not this believe
Without  sensible  true avouch
Of mine own eyes.


MARCELLUS

                    not like  king?


HORATIO

As thou art  thyself:
Such   very armour  had 
   ambitious Norway combated;
 frown'd  once, ,  an angry parle,
 smote  sledded Polacks   ice.
'Tis strange.


MARCELLUS

Thus twice before,  jump  this dead hour,
With martial stalk hath  gone by our watch.


HORATIO

  particular thought  work  know not;
   gross  scope   opinion,
This bodes some strange eruption  our state.


MARCELLUS

Good , sit down,  tell ,   knows,
Why this same strict  most observant watch
 nightly toils  subject   land,
 why such daily cast  brazen cannon,
 foreign mart  implements  war;
Why such impress  shipwrights, whose sore task
Does not divide  Sunday from  week;
 might  toward,  this sweaty haste
Doth make  night joint-labourer   day:
Who 't  can inform ?


HORATIO

That can ;
At least,  whisper goes . Our last king,
Whose image even   appear'd  us,
,   know, by Fortinbras  Norway,
Thereto prick'd  by  most emulate pride,
Dared   combat;  which our valiant Hamlet--
  this side  our known world esteem'd --
Did slay this Fortinbras; who by  seal'd compact,
Well ratified by law  heraldry,
Did forfeit,   life,    lands
Which  stood seized ,   conqueror:
Against  which,  moiety competent
 gaged by our king; which had return'd
  inheritance  Fortinbras,
Had  been vanquisher; , by  same covenant,
 carriage   article design'd,
His fell  Hamlet. , sir, young Fortinbras,
Of unimproved mettle hot  full,
Hath   skirts  Norway here  there
Shark'd   list  lawless resolutes,
 food  diet,  some enterprise
That hath  stomach 't; which   other--
As  doth well appear unto our state--
  recover  us, by strong hand
 terms compulsatory,  foresaid lands
 by  father lost:  this,  take ,
  main motive  our preparations,
 source  this our watch   chief head
Of this post-haste  romage   land.


BERNARDO

 think    other  e'en :
Well   sort  this portentous figure
Comes armed through our watch;  like  king
That     question  these wars.


HORATIO

 mote    trouble  mind's eye.
  most high  palmy state  Rome,
 little ere  mightiest Julius fell,
 graves stood tenantless   sheeted dead
Did squeak  gibber   Roman streets:
As stars  trains  fire  dews  blood,
Disasters   sun;   moist star
Upon whose influence Neptune's empire stands
 sick almost  doomsday  eclipse:
 even  like precurse  fierce events,
As harbingers preceding still  fates
 prologue   omen coming ,
Have heaven  earth together demonstrated
Unto our climatures  countrymen.--
 soft, behold! lo,   comes again!
Re-enter Ghost
'll cross , though  blast . Stay, illusion!
 thou hast any sound,  use  voice,
Speak  :
 there  any good thing   done,
That   thee  ease  grace  ,
Speak  :
Cock crows
 thou art privy  thy country's fate,
Which, happily, foreknowing  avoid, O, speak!
  thou hast uphoarded  thy life
Extorted treasure   womb  earth,
 which, they say,  spirits oft walk  death,
Speak  : stay,  speak! Stop , Marcellus.


MARCELLUS

Shall  strike     partisan?


HORATIO

,    not stand.


BERNARDO

'Tis here!


HORATIO

'Tis here!


MARCELLUS

'Tis gone!
Exit Ghost
We   wrong, being  majestical,
 offer   show  violence;
  ,   air, invulnerable,
 our vain blows malicious mockery.


BERNARDO

  about  speak,   cock crew.


HORATIO

 then  started like  guilty thing
Upon  fearful summons.  have heard,
 cock,    trumpet   morn,
Doth   lofty  shrill-sounding throat
Awake  god  day; ,   warning,
Whether  sea  fire,  earth  air,
 extravagant  erring spirit hies
  confine:    truth herein
This present object made probation.


MARCELLUS

 faded   crowing   cock.
Some say  ever 'gainst  season comes
Wherein our Saviour's birth  celebrated,
 bird  dawning singeth  night long:
 then, they say,  spirit dares stir abroad;
 nights  wholesome; then  planets strike,
 fairy takes, nor witch hath power  charm,
 hallow'd   gracious   time.


HORATIO

 have  heard    part believe .
, look,  morn,  russet mantle clad,
Walks o'er  dew  yon high eastward hill:
Break  our watch ;  by  advice,
Let us impart   have seen -night
Unto young Hamlet; , upon  life,
This spirit, dumb  us,  speak  .
  consent  shall acquaint   ,
As needful  our loves, fitting our duty?


MARCELLUS

Let's 't,  pray;   this morning know
  shall find  most conveniently.

KING CLAUDIUS

Though yet  Hamlet our dear brother's death

Yet  far hath discretion fought  nature
That   wisest sorrow think  ,

Therefore our sometime sister,  our queen,

Have ,  'twere   defeated joy,--
With an auspicious   dropping eye,
With mirth  funeral   dirge  marriage,

Taken  wife: nor have  herein barr'd
Your better wisdoms, which have freely gone
With this affair along.  , our thanks.

Holding  weak supposal  our worth,
 thinking by our late dear brother's death
Our state   disjoint  out  frame,
Colleagued   dream   advantage,
 hath not fail'd  pester us  message,
Importing  surrender   lands
Lost by  father,   bonds  law,
 our most valiant brother.  much  .
  ourself   this time  meeting:
Thus much  business :  have here writ
 Norway, uncle  young Fortinbras,--
Who, impotent  bed-rid, scarcely hears
Of this  nephew's purpose,-- suppress
His further gait herein;    levies,
 lists  full proportions,   made
Out   subject:   here dispatch
, good Cornelius,  , Voltimand,
 bearers  this greeting  old Norway;
Giving    further personal power

Of these delated articles allow.
Farewell,  let your haste commend your duty.


CORNELIUS

VOLTIMAND

KING CLAUDIUS

We doubt  nothing: heartily farewell.
Exeunt VOLTIMAND  CORNELIUS
 , Laertes, 's  news  ?
 told us  some suit;  't, Laertes?
 cannot speak  reason   Dane,
 loose your voice:  wouldst thou beg, Laertes,
That shall not   offer, not thy asking?
 head  not more native   heart,
 hand more instrumental   mouth,
Than   throne  Denmark  thy father.
 wouldst thou have, Laertes?


LAERTES

 dread lord,
Your leave  favour  return  France;
From whence though willingly  came  Denmark,
 show  duty  your coronation,
Yet ,  must confess,  duty done,
 thoughts  wishes bend again toward France
 bow   your gracious leave  pardon.


KING CLAUDIUS

Have  your father's leave?  says Polonius?


LORD POLONIUS

 hath,  lord, wrung from   slow leave
By laboursome petition,   last
Upon    seal'd  hard consent:
  beseech , give  leave  go.


KING CLAUDIUS

Take thy fair hour, Laertes; time  thine,
 thy best graces spend   thy !
 ,  cousin Hamlet,   son,--


HAMLET

[Aside]   little more than kin,  less than kind.


KING CLAUDIUS

How     clouds still hang  ?


HAMLET

Not ,  lord;   too much '  sun.


QUEEN GERTRUDE

Good Hamlet, cast thy nighted colour off,
 let thine eye look like  friend  Denmark.
 not  ever  thy vailed lids
Seek  thy noble father   dust:
Thou know'st 'tis common;   lives must die,
Passing through nature  eternity.


HAMLET

Ay, madam,   common.


QUEEN GERTRUDE

  ,
Why seems   particular  thee?


HAMLET

Seems, madam! nay  ;  know not 'seems.'
'Tis not alone  inky cloak, good mother,
Nor customary suits  solemn black,
Nor windy suspiration  forced breath,
, nor  fruitful river   eye,
Nor  dejected 'havior   visage,
Together   forms, moods, shapes  grief,
That can denote  truly: these indeed seem,
 they  actions   man might play:
  have  within which passeth show;
These   trappings   suits  woe.


KING CLAUDIUS

'Tis sweet  commendable  your nature, Hamlet,
 give these mourning duties  your father:
,  must know, your father lost  father;
That father lost, lost ,   survivor bound
 filial obligation  some term
  obsequious sorrow:   persever
 obstinate condolement   course
Of impious stubbornness; 'tis unmanly grief;
 shows   most incorrect  heaven,
 heart unfortified,  mind impatient,
An understanding simple  unschool'd:
   know must     common
As any  most vulgar thing  sense,
Why should   our peevish opposition
Take   heart? Fie! 'tis  fault  heaven,
 fault against  dead,  fault  nature,
 reason most absurd: whose common theme
 death  fathers,  who still hath cried,
From  first corse till   died -day,
'This must  .' We pray , throw  earth
This unprevailing woe,  think  us
As   father:  let  world take note,
   most immediate  our throne;
   less nobility  love
Than  which dearest father bears  son,
  impart toward .  your intent
 going back  school  Wittenberg,
  most retrograde  our desire:
  beseech , bend   remain
Here,   cheer  comfort  our eye,
Our chiefest courtier, cousin,  our son.


QUEEN GERTRUDE

Let not thy mother lose  prayers, Hamlet:
 pray thee, stay  us; go not  Wittenberg.


HAMLET

 shall    best obey , madam.


KING CLAUDIUS

Why, 'tis  loving   fair reply:
Be  ourself  Denmark. Madam, come;
This gentle  unforced accord  Hamlet
Sits smiling   heart:  grace whereof,
 jocund health  Denmark drinks -day,
  great cannon   clouds shall tell,
  king's rouse  heavens  bruit again,
Re-speaking earthly thunder. Come away.
Exeunt   HAMLET


HAMLET

O,  this too too solid flesh  melt
Thaw  resolve itself into  dew!
   Everlasting had not fix'd
His canon 'gainst self-slaughter! O God! God!
How weary, stale, flat  unprofitable,
Seem     uses  this world!
Fie 't! ah fie! 'tis an unweeded garden,
That grows  seed; things rank  gross  nature
Possess  merely. That  should come  this!
 two months dead: nay, not  much, not two:
 excellent  king;  ,  this,
Hyperion   satyr;  loving   mother
That  might not beteem  winds  heaven
Visit  face too roughly. Heaven  earth!
Must  remember? why,   hang  ,
As  increase  appetite had grown
By   fed :  yet, within  month--
Let  not think 't--Frailty, thy name  woman!--
 little month,  ere  shoes were old
With which  follow'd  poor father's body,
Like Niobe,  tears:--why , even --
O, God!  beast,  wants discourse  reason,
 have mourn'd longer--married   uncle,
 father's brother,   more like  father
Than   Hercules: within  month:
Ere yet  salt  most unrighteous tears
Had left  flushing   galled eyes,
 married. O, most wicked speed,  post
With such dexterity  incestuous sheets!
  not nor  cannot come  good:
 break,  heart;   must hold  tongue.
Enter HORATIO, MARCELLUS,  BERNARDO

Nor shall   mine ear  violence,

Against yourself:  know    truant.

We'll teach   drink deep ere  depart.


HORATIO

HAMLET

HORATIO

Indeed,  lord,  follow'd hard upon.


HAMLET

Thrift, thrift, Horatio!  funeral baked meats
Did coldly furnish forth  marriage tables.

HORATIO

HORATIO

Season your admiration  awhile
With an attent ear, till   deliver,
Upon  witness  these gentlemen,
This marvel  .


HAMLET

 God's love, let  hear.


HORATIO

Two nights together had these gentlemen,
Marcellus  Bernardo,  their watch,
  dead vast  middle   night,
Been thus encounter'd.  figure like your father,
Armed  point exactly, cap--pe,
Appears before ,   solemn march
Goes slow  stately by : thrice  walk'd
By their oppress'd  fear-surprised eyes,
Within  truncheon's length; whilst they, distilled
Almost  jelly   act  fear,
Stand dumb  speak not  . This  
 dreadful secrecy impart they did;
     third night kept  watch;
,  they had deliver'd, both  time,
Form   thing, each word made true  good,
 apparition comes:  knew your father;
These hands  not more like.


HAMLET

   this?


MARCELLUS

 lord, upon  platform   watch'd.


HAMLET

Did  not speak  ?


HORATIO

 lord,  did;
 answer made  none: yet once methought
 lifted  its head  did address
Itself  motion, like    speak;
 even then  morning cock crew loud,
   sound  shrunk  haste away,
 vanish'd from our sight.


HAMLET

'Tis very strange.


HORATIO

As   live,  honour'd lord, 'tis true;
  did think  writ down  our duty
 let  know  .


HAMLET

Indeed, indeed, sirs,  this troubles .
Hold   watch -night?

HAMLET

Arm'd, say ?

HAMLET

Then saw  not  face?


HORATIO

O, ,  lord;  wore  beaver .

HORATIO

HAMLET

Pale  red?


HORATIO

Nay, very pale.


HAMLET

HORATIO

Most constantly.


HAMLET

                     had been there.


HORATIO

  have much amazed .


HAMLET

Very like, very like. Stay'd  long?


HORATIO

While one  moderate haste might tell  hundred.


MARCELLUS

Longer, longer.


HORATIO

Not   saw't.

Let   tenable  your silence still;
 whatsoever else shall hap -night,
Give  an understanding,   tongue:

Upon  platform, 'twixt eleven  twelve,

Exeunt   HAMLET

Till then sit still,  soul: foul deeds  rise,
Though   earth o'erwhelm ,  men's eyes.

Enter LAERTES  OPHELIA


LAERTES

 necessaries  embark'd: farewell:
, sister,   winds give benefit
 convoy  assistant,  not sleep,
 let  hear from .


OPHELIA

  doubt ?


LAERTES

 Hamlet   trifling   favour,
Hold   fashion   toy  blood,
 violet   youth  primy nature,
Forward, not permanent, sweet, not lasting,
 perfume  suppliance   minute;  more.


OPHELIA

        more  ?


LAERTES

Think   more;
 nature, crescent, does not grow alone
 thews  bulk, ,  this temple waxes,
 inward service   mind  soul
Grows wide withal. Perhaps  loves  ,
   soil nor cautel doth besmirch
 virtue   :   must fear,
His greatness weigh'd,    not  own;
  himself  subject   birth:
  not,  unvalued persons ,
Carve  himself;    choice depends
 safety  health  this whole state;
 therefore must  choice  circumscribed
Unto  voice  yielding   body
Whereof    head. Then   says  loves ,
 fits your wisdom  far  believe 
As    particular act  place
May give  saying deed; which   further
Than  main voice  Denmark goes withal.
Then weigh  loss your honour  sustain,
  too credent ear  list  songs,
 lose your heart,  your chaste treasure open
  unmaster'd importunity.
Fear , Ophelia, fear ,  dear sister,
 keep    rear  your affection,
Out   shot  danger  desire.
 chariest maid  prodigal enough,
  unmask  beauty   moon:
Virtue itself 'scapes not calumnious strokes:
 canker galls  infants   spring,
Too oft before their buttons  disclosed,
   morn  liquid dew  youth
Contagious blastments  most imminent.
Be wary then; best safety lies  fear:
Youth  itself rebels, though none else near.


OPHELIA

 shall  effect  this good lesson keep,
As watchman   heart. , good  brother,
 not,  some ungracious pastors ,
Show   steep  thorny way  heaven;
Whiles, like  puff'd  reckless libertine,
Himself  primrose path  dalliance treads,
 recks not  own rede.


LAERTES

O, fear  not.
 stay too long:  here  father comes.
Enter POLONIUS
 double blessing   double grace,
Occasion smiles upon  second leave.


LORD POLONIUS

Yet here, Laertes! aboard, aboard,  shame!
 wind sits   shoulder  your sail,
   stay'd . There;  blessing  thee!
 these few precepts  thy memory
See thou character. Give thy thoughts  tongue,
Nor any unproportioned thought  act.
Be thou familiar,  by  means vulgar.
Those friends thou hast,  their adoption tried,
Grapple   thy soul  hoops  steel;
  not dull thy palm  entertainment
Of each new-hatch'd, unfledged comrade. Beware
Of entrance   quarrel,  being ,
Bear't   opposed  beware  thee.
Give every man thy ear,  few thy voice;
Take each man's censure,  reserve thy judgment.
Costly thy habit  thy purse can buy,
 not express'd  fancy; rich, not gaudy;
  apparel oft proclaims  man,
 they  France   best rank  station
Are   most select  generous chief  .
Neither  borrower nor  lender ;
 loan oft loses both itself  friend,
 borrowing dulls  edge  husbandry.
This above :  thine ownself  true,
  must follow,   night  day,
Thou canst not then  false  any man.
Farewell:  blessing season this  thee!


LAERTES

Most humbly   take  leave,  lord.


LORD POLONIUS

 time invites ; go; your servants tend.


LAERTES

Farewell, Ophelia;  remember well
  have said  .


OPHELIA

'Tis   memory lock'd,
  yourself shall keep  key  .


LAERTES

Farewell.
Exit


LORD POLONIUS

 't, Ophelia,  hath said  ?


OPHELIA

 please , something touching  Lord Hamlet.


LORD POLONIUS

Marry, well bethought:
'Tis told ,  hath very oft  late
Given private time  ;   yourself
Have  your audience been most free  bounteous:
   ,   'tis put  ,
   way  caution,  must tell ,
  not understand yourself  clearly
As  behoves  daughter  your honour.
  between ? give    truth.


OPHELIA

 hath,  lord,  late made many tenders
Of  affection  .


LORD POLONIUS

Affection! pooh!  speak like  green girl,
Unsifted  such perilous circumstance.
  believe  tenders,   call ?


OPHELIA

  not know,  lord,   should think.


LORD POLONIUS

Marry, 'll teach : think yourself  baby;
That  have ta'en these tenders  true pay,
Which  not sterling. Tender yourself more dearly;
--not  crack  wind   poor phrase,
Running  thus--'ll tender   fool.


OPHELIA

 lord,  hath importuned   love
 honourable fashion.


LORD POLONIUS

Ay, fashion   call ; go , go .


OPHELIA

 hath given countenance   speech,  lord,
With almost   holy vows  heaven.


LORD POLONIUS

Ay, springes  catch woodcocks.   know,
  blood burns, how prodigal  soul
Lends  tongue vows: these blazes, daughter,
Giving more light than heat, extinct  both,
Even  their promise,    -making,
 must not take  fire. From this time
Be somewhat scanter  your maiden presence;
Set your entreatments   higher rate
Than  command  parley.  Lord Hamlet,
Believe  much  ,    young
   larger tether   walk
Than   given :  few, Ophelia,
 not believe  vows;  they  brokers,
Not   dye which their investments show,
 mere implorators  unholy suits,
Breathing like sanctified  pious bawds,
 better  beguile. This   :
  not,  plain terms, from this time forth,
Have   slander any moment leisure,
As  give words  talk   Lord Hamlet.
Look 't,  charge : come your ways.


OPHELIA

 shall obey,  lord.

Ay, marry, 't:

More honour'd   breach than  observance.
This heavy-headed revel east  west

From our achievements, though perform'd  height,

Oft breaking down  pales  forts  reason,
 by some habit  too much o'er-leavens
 form  plausive manners,  these men,
Carrying,  say,  stamp  one defect,
Being nature's livery,  fortune's star,--
Their virtues else-- they  pure  grace,
As infinite  man  undergo--
Shall   general censure take corruption
From  particular fault:  dram  eale
Doth   noble substance   doubt
  own scandal.

Look,  lord,  comes!
Enter Ghost


HAMLET

Angels  ministers  grace defend us!
Be thou  spirit  health  goblin damn'd,
Bring  thee airs from heaven  blasts from hell,
Be thy intents wicked  charitable,
Thou comest  such  questionable shape
That   speak  thee: 'll call thee Hamlet,
King, father, royal Dane: O, answer !
Let  not burst  ignorance;  tell
Why thy canonized bones, hearsed  death,
Have burst their cerements; why  sepulchre,
Wherein  saw thee quietly inurn'd,
Hath oped  ponderous  marble jaws,
 cast thee  again.   this mean,
That thou, dead corse, again  complete steel
Revisit'st thus  glimpses   moon,
Making night hideous;   fools  nature
 horridly  shake our disposition
With thoughts beyond  reaches  our souls?
Say, why  this? wherefore?  should  ?

   dreadful summit   cliff
That beetles o'er  base into  sea,
 there assume some other horrible form,
Which might deprive your sovereignty  reason

Without more motive, into every brain
That looks  many fathoms   sea

Make thy two eyes, like stars, start from their spheres,
Thy knotted  combined locks  part

With witchcraft   wit,  traitorous gifts,--

Brief let  . Sleeping within  orchard,
 custom always   afternoon,
Upon  secure hour thy uncle stole,
With juice  cursed hebenon   vial,
   porches   ears did pour
 leperous distilment; whose effect
Holds such an enmity  blood  man
That swift  quicksilver  courses through
 natural gates  alleys   body,

Most lazar-like,  vile  loathsome crust,

Thus  , sleeping, by  brother's hand
Of life,  crown,  queen,  once dispatch'd:
Cut off even   blossoms   sin,
Unhousel'd, disappointed, unanel'd,
 reckoning made,  sent   account
With   imperfections   head:
O, horrible! O, horrible! most horrible!
 thou hast nature  thee, bear  not;
Let not  royal bed  Denmark 
 couch  luxury  damned incest.

Taint not thy mind, nor let thy soul contrive
Against thy mother aught: leave   heaven
   thorns    bosom lodge,

Adieu, adieu! Hamlet, remember .

Ay, thou poor ghost, while memory holds  seat
 this distracted globe. Remember thee!
Yea, from  table   memory

 saws  books,  forms,  pressures past,
That youth  observation copied there;

Within  book  volume   brain,
Unmix'd  baser matter: , by heaven!

O villain, villain, smiling, damned villain!

More grief  hide than hate  utter love.

On Fortinbras; which ,  brief, obeys;
Receives rebuke from Norway,   fine
Makes vow before  uncle never more

Whereon old Norway, overcome  joy,
Gives  three thousand crowns  annual fee,

Through your dominions  this enterprise,

As  perceived ,  must tell  ,
Before  daughter told -- might ,
  dear majesty your queen here, think,

 given  heart  winking, mute  dumb,
 look'd upon this love  idle sight;
 might  think? ,  went round  work,
  young mistress thus  did bespeak:
'Lord Hamlet   prince, out  thy star;
This must not :'  then  precepts gave ,
That  should lock herself from  resort,
Admit  messengers, receive  tokens.
Which done,  took  fruits   advice;
 , repulsed-- short tale  make--
Fell into  sadness, then into  fast,
Thence   watch, thence into  weakness,
Thence   lightness, , by this declension,
Into  madness wherein   raves,
   mourn .


KING CLAUDIUS

  think 'tis this?


QUEEN GERTRUDE

Hath there been such  time--'d fain know --
That  have positively said 'Tis ,'

Let    assistant   state,

never acted; ,   , not above once;  
play,  remember, pleased not  million; 'twas
caviare   general:   --  received
,  others, whose judgments  such matters
cried   top  mine--an excellent play, well
digested   scenes, set down   much
modesty  cunning.  remember, one said there
were  sallets   lines  make  matter
savoury, nor  matter   phrase  might
indict  author  affectation;  called  an
honest method,  wholesome  sweet,  by very
much more handsome than fine. One speech   
chiefly loved: 'twas Aeneas' tale  Dido; 
thereabout   especially,   speaks 
Priam's slaughter:   live  your memory, begin
 this line: let  see, let  see--
' rugged Pyrrhus, like  Hyrcanian beast,'--
  not :-- begins  Pyrrhus:--
' rugged Pyrrhus,  whose sable arms,
Black   purpose, did  night resemble
  lay couched   ominous horse,
Hath  this dread  black complexion smear'd
With heraldry more dismal; head  foot
   total gules; horridly trick'd
With blood  fathers, mothers, daughters, sons,
Baked  impasted   parching streets,
That lend  tyrannous  damned light
 their lord's murder: roasted  wrath  fire,
 thus o'er-sized  coagulate gore,
With eyes like carbuncles,  hellish Pyrrhus
Old grandsire Priam seeks.'

LORD POLONIUS

'Fore God,  lord, well spoken,  good accent 
good discretion.


First Player

'Anon  finds 
Striking too short  Greeks;  antique sword,
Rebellious   arm, lies   falls,
Repugnant  command: unequal match'd,
Pyrrhus  Priam drives;  rage strikes wide;
   whiff  wind   fell sword
 unnerved father falls. Then senseless Ilium,
Seeming  feel this blow,  flaming top
Stoops   base,    hideous crash
Takes prisoner Pyrrhus' ear: , lo!  sword,
Which  declining   milky head
Of reverend Priam, seem'd '  air  stick:
,   painted tyrant, Pyrrhus stood,
 like  neutral     matter,
Did nothing.
,   often see, against some storm,
 silence   heavens,  rack stand still,
 bold winds speechless   orb below
As hush  death, anon  dreadful thunder
Doth rend  region, , after Pyrrhus' pause,
Aroused vengeance sets  new -work;
 never did  Cyclops' hammers fall
On Mars's armour forged  proof eterne
With less remorse than Pyrrhus' bleeding sword
 falls  Priam.
Out, out, thou strumpet, Fortune!   gods,

Break   spokes  fellies from  wheel,

As low    fiends!'

LORD POLONIUS

That's good; 'mobled queen'  good.


First Player

'Run barefoot   down, threatening  flames
With bisson rheum;  clout upon  head

About  lank   o'er-teemed loins,

'Gainst Fortune's state  treason have

Unless things mortal move  not  ,

Like John--dreams, unpregnant   cause,

Upon whose property  most dear life

Who calls  villain? breaks  pate across?
Plucks off  beard,  blows    face?
Tweaks  by  nose? gives   lie '  throat,
As deep    lungs? who does  this?
Ha!

O, vengeance!
Why,  an ass  ! This  most brave,
That ,  son   dear father murder'd,
Prompted   revenge by heaven  hell,
Must, like  whore, unpack  heart  words,

Fie upon't! foh! About,  brain!  have heard
That guilty creatures sitting   play
Have by  very cunning   scene
Been struck    soul  presently
They have proclaim'd their malefactions;
 murder, though  have  tongue,  speak
With most miraculous organ. 'll have these players
Play something like  murder   father
Before mine uncle: 'll observe  looks;
'll tent    quick:    blench,

May   devil:   devil hath power
 assume  pleasing shape; yea,  perhaps
Out   weakness   melancholy,
As   very potent  such spirits,
Abuses   damn : 'll have grounds
More relative than this:  play 's  thing
Wherein 'll catch  conscience   king.

About  world have times twelve thirties been,
Since love our hearts  Hymen did our hands
Unite commutual  most sacred bands.


Player Queen

Make us again count o'er ere love  done!

 far from cheer  from your former state,
That  distrust . Yet, though  distrust,
Discomfort ,  lord,  nothing must:
 women's fear  love holds quantity;
 neither aught,   extremity.
,   love , proof hath made  know;
   love  sized,  fear  :
 love  great,  littlest doubts  fear;
 little fears grow great, great love grows there.


Player King

'Faith,  must leave thee, love,  shortly too;
 operant powers their functions leave  :
 thou shalt live  this fair world behind,
Honour'd, beloved;  haply one  kind

Such love must needs  treason   breast:

Whether love lead fortune,  else fortune love.

Upon  heat  flame  thy distemper
Sprinkle cool patience. Whereon   look?

LAERTES

Drown'd! O, ?


QUEEN GERTRUDE

There   willow grows aslant  brook,
That shows  hoar leaves   glassy stream;
There  fantastic garlands did  come
Of crow-flowers, nettles, daisies,  long purples
That liberal shepherds give  grosser name,
 our cold maids  dead men's fingers call :
There,   pendent boughs  coronet weeds
Clambering  hang, an envious sliver broke;
 down  weedy trophies  herself
Fell   weeping brook.  clothes spread wide;
, mermaid-like, awhile they bore  :
Which time  chanted snatches  old tunes;
As one incapable   own distress,
 like  creature native  indued
Unto  element:  long  could not 
Till   garments, heavy  their drink,
Pull'd  poor wretch from  melodious lay
 muddy death.


LAERTES

                  Alas, then,   drown'd?


QUEEN GERTRUDE

Drown'd, drown'd.


LAERTES

Too much  water hast thou, poor Ophelia,
 therefore  forbid  tears:  yet

Let shame say   :  these  gone,

First Clown

Why, there thou say'st:   more pity 
great folk should have countenance  this world

Second Clown

Why,  had none.

Yet here   allow'd  virgin crants,
 maiden strewments   bringing home
Of bell  burial.

We should profane  service   dead

As  peace-parted souls.

LAERTES

O, treble woe
Fall ten times treble   cursed head,
Whose wicked deed thy most ingenious sense
Deprived thee ! Hold off  earth awhile,
Till  have caught  once more  mine arms:
Leaps into  grave
 pile your dust upon  quick  dead,
Till  this flat  mountain  have made,
 o'ertop old Pelion,   skyish head
Of blue Olympus.

Bears such an emphasis? whose phrase  sorrow
Conjures  wandering stars,  makes  stand
Like wonder-wounded hearers? This  ,

That  not let  sleep: methought  lay
Worse than  mutines   bilboes. Rashly,
 praised  rashness  , let us know,
Our indiscretion sometimes serves us well,
 our deep plots  pall:   should teach us
There's  divinity  shapes our ends,
Rough-hew  how  ,--


HORATIO

That  most certain.

Up from  cabin,
 sea-gown scarf'd about ,   dark
Groped   find out ; had  desire.
Finger'd their packet,   fine withdrew
 mine own room again; making  bold,
 fears forgetting manners,  unseal
Their grand commission;   found, Horatio,--
O royal knavery!--an exact command,
Larded  many several sorts  reasons
Importing Denmark's health  England's too,
With, ho! such bugs  goblins   life,
That,   supervise,  leisure bated,

Here's  commission: read   more leisure.
 wilt thou hear  how  did proceed?


HORATIO

Ere  could make  prologue   brains,

As England   faithful tributary,
As love between  like  palm might flourish,
As peace should stiff  wheaten garland wear

That,   view  knowing  these contents,
Without debatement further, more  less,

Not shriving-time allow'd.

Thou know'st already.

They  not near  conscience; their defeat
Does by their own insinuation grow:
'Tis dangerous   baser nature comes
Between  pass  fell incensed points
Of mighty opposites.


HORATIO

Why,   king  this!


HAMLET

Does  not, think'st thee, stand   upon--

Popp'd  between  election   hopes,
Thrown out  angle   proper life,

HAMLET

Give  your pardon, sir: 've done  wrong;

This presence knows,
  must needs have heard, how   punish'd
With sore distraction.   have done,
That might your nature, honour  exception
Roughly awake,  here proclaim  madness.
't Hamlet wrong'd Laertes? Never Hamlet:
 Hamlet from himself  ta'en away,
  's not himself does wrong Laertes,
Then Hamlet does  not, Hamlet denies .
Who does , then? His madness: 't  ,
Hamlet    faction   wrong'd;
His madness  poor Hamlet's enemy.
Sir,  this audience,
Let  disclaiming from  purposed evil
Free   far  your most generous thoughts,
That  have shot mine arrow o'er  house,
 hurt  brother.


LAERTES

Whose motive,  this case, should stir  most
  revenge:    terms  honour

Till by some elder masters,  known honour,

Richer than  which four successive kings
 Denmark's crown have worn. Give   cups;

 cannons   heavens,  heavens  earth,
'  king dunks  Hamlet.' Come, begin:

Things standing thus unknown, shall live behind !

Of carnal, bloody,  unnatural acts,
Of accidental judgments, casual slaughters,
Of deaths put  by cunning  forced cause,
